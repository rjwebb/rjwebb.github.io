                one possibility is to migrate from larger catch-all services

              <li>
                there are too many web standards and they are too complex
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    as a result, it is almost impossible to create a new web
                    browser
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    it looks like we will eventually only have one web browser
                    that is used by most people (google chrome)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    i do not think that google should be able to dictate what
                    the web looks like
                  </li>
                  <li>does this mean that we should abandon the web?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                in a lot of cases, the web no longer works like a web
                <ul>
                  <li>http is designed to access hyperlinked documents</li>
                  <li>
                    but a lot of what we do happens on web apps, which may or
                    may not behave like documents
                  </li>
                </ul>

            post-free software
            <ul>
              <li>
                permissive software licences have failed to protect the rights
                of developers and the users of software
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    free/open source software is used everywhere behind the
                    scenes, which has arguably made software development cheaper
                    and easier for a lot of people (companies)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    but most of what most people do on computers nowadays makes
                    use of software platforms (e.g. web apps) that definitely do
                    not grant them freedom
                  </li>

        philosophy of science + engineering
        <ul>
          <li>just read 'making social science matter' by flyvbjerg</li>
          <li>
            what is the difference between hard science and soft science?
            <ul>
              <li>
                hard science is more about discovering rules and facts about how
                a system works
              </li>
              <li>
                soft science is about systematically improving our judgement,
                its discoveries are context-dependent and oriented towards
                action
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            is software engineering more like hard science or soft science?
            <ul>
              <li>i think it's more like soft science</li>
              <li>
                it does have some basis in hard science/episteme (maths, CS, EE)
                and contains a lot of techne (applied knowledge) but there is a
                form of competence that cannot be expressed in these terms
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    the remaining third kind of knowledge (phronesis) can be
                    recorded in thick case studies
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            it's also interesting to consider the relationship between software
            engineering and "real" engineering (such as electrical engineering,
            civil engineering, etc. there is this idea that software engineering
            is not "real" engineering because it relies less heavily on episteme
            and techne.
            <ul>
              <li>
                i am curious... to what extent do fields in "real" engineering
                actually live up their own standards? to what extent do they use
                intuition and experience when making decisions over rigid rules
                and formalised knowledge? if we use the dreyfus model of skill
                acquisition (as flyvbjerg does when talking about social
                science) then "real" engineering at the proficient/expert level
                is also highly phronetic and probably not that different to
                software engineering.
              </li>
              <li>
                perhaps a reason for the prevalance of the "software engineering
                is not real engineering" meme is that the arguments for it
                mostly concern the kinds of knowledge that people at lower
                levels of ability focus on, but those distinctions disappear at
                higher levels!
              </li>
              <li>
                at the top of every discipline, above the clouds... there is
                just wisdom
