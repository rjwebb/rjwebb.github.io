      <p>
        This was a good weekend. I did a decent amount of exercise (climbing on
        Saturday, ~4 miles run on Sunday along the Thames) and had a good time
        talking to people over Zoom and at brunch. It felt really good, apart
        from when I thought about how this is not <i>productive</i>.

        This video is incredible. Skip to 1:39 if you just want to see the clip
        where the action happens. Timothy Gallwey, the author of "The Inner Game
        of Tennis" teaches a lady with no prior knowledge of tennis how to play
        in <i>twenty minutes</i>.

        After the clip, Alan Kay mentions some key points of "The Inner Game of
        Tennis". I won't go over them here, but it's worth watching the video to
        learn about them. These principles could easily apply to other difficult
        activities. Mr Gallwey is well aware of this - the "Inner Game of..."
        series includes books on Golf, Work, Music and Stress.
