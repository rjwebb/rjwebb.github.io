      I haven't updated this website in a long time. I know, I know, it's such a clich&eacute; thing to post
      on a personal site. My intention with bob dot website was to present a positive side of myself to the
      world that I felt I was hiding away - someone who is intelligent, creative and able to express himself in
      <i>eloquent prose</i>. As a result, my standards for putting anything on here were paralysingly high. If
      I wanted to talk about something, I found it a lot easier to write a tweet or a facebook update or just
      send someone a message. However, there is another (much more embarrassing) reason why I haven't been
      posting here... I forgot how to update this website.

      Up until now, I used some hand-written code (in Python) to produce formatted HTML pages from markdown files.
      Since writing my <a href="2020-12-01.html#01-how-i-update-this-website">last post</a> (ironically this
      documented how I update this website, but did not include the site generation code itself) I have
      bought a new computer (an M1 Macbook Air) and I have not yet transferred my old coding projects from my
      backups to my new machine. I still haven't done this, by the way. To be honest, every time I look at
      my old projects folders I feel a bit guilty. They remind me of the things I tried and gave up on. I'd
      rather not look at them.

      Fortunately, I have figured out how to update this website without using a static site generator - just
      write HTML by hand. I wrote the site generator to produce really simple HTML (look at the source of this
      page) so it was easy to copy a file and change the content. Thank you to
      <a href="https://twitter.com/htmlenergy">HTML Energy</a> for reminding us every day that you can just
      write HTML. I'm also grateful to the various <a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">manifesto-writers</a>
      and <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/">designers</a> who promote Brutalist web design. If we
      appreciate that simple websites are good, then it becomes easier to make new websites.
