        My new phone arrived in the mail today, which means that I now have to
        set it up. This is mostly a painless process, but there are a few
        annoying steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Copying data from the micro sd card to some other device so that I can
          reformat it when putting it in my new phone. My phone(s) are the only
          things that have micro sd ports, so I have to figure out how to get
          the data on some other device e.g. by putting the phone into developer
          mode and copying data to my laptop using adb?
        </li>
        <li>
          The fiddly dance where I install WhatsApp on my new phone, verify my
          phone number, then realise that there is no message backlog, which
          requires me to verify my phone number on my old phone, back up my
          messages to the cloud, then enable WhatsApp on my new phone and
          download the backups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recovering the passwords for apps where I never wrote down the
          password in an actual password manager.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The thing that all of the above activities have in common is that they
        involve me forgetting to do something in preparation, jumping into the
        phone setup process, then having to backtrack and figure the thing out
        the hard way.
      </p>

        I think that there are a number of tasks like this, where they involve
        some amount of knowledge and care, but nobody does them often enough to
        be any good at them. Unfortunately, a lot of these tasks are very
        important and can cause a lot of problems if we do not do them well.
        Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moving house</li>
        <li>Buying and selling property</li>
        <li>Breaking up with someone</li>
        <li>Divorce</li>
        <li>Going to university</li>
        <li>Taking exams</li>
        <li>Quitting your job</li>
        <li>Applying for jobs</li>
        <li>Having children</li>
        <li>Experiencing the death of a loved one</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How do we get good at these things? The obvious answer is practice - but
        in a lot of these cases, it would be for the best if they happened as
        rarely as possible. Another approach is to instead become someone who is
        an expert at helping other people face these situations. Unfortunately,
