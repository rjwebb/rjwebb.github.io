  <h2>Nintendo DS homebrew notes</h2>

  <p>I'd like to write a homebrew game/application for the Nintendo DS. This is currently a WIP - I have tried before
    but gotten seriously sidetracked, e.g. trying to create a Nix build process for devkitPro.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The easiest way to compile homebrew on an Apple Silicon computer is currently to use devkitPro's <a
        href="https://github.com/devkitPro/docker">docker images</a>.</li>
    <li>DeSmuME does not run Nintendo DS homebrew ROMs - this is really annoying. Do homebrew developers test their
      programs by constantly taking out the SD card of their computer and putting into their console? The only other
      approach I know of would be to get hold of an Intelligent Systems <a
        href="https://www.retroreversing.com/nintendo-ds-development-kit/">development kit</a>. These are rare and hard
      to obtain, which is unsurprising given that they were only made available to companies that officially developed
      Nintendo DS games. I bet that most copies either still live in the storage cupboards of existing games companies,
      or were destroyed...
    </li>
    <li>
      There aren't any schematics online for cartridges such as the R4DS...
    </li>
  </ul>
