  <h2>"Systems ideas that sound good but almost never work"</h2>

  <p>
    I was sent <a href="https://x.com/martin_casado/status/1872822491829420241">this tweet</a> today:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Systems ideas that sound good but almost never work:<br><br>- DSLs<br>- Live migrating
      process state<br>- Anomaly detection<br>- Control loops responding to system load <br>- Multi-master writes<br>-

  <p>(Thanks <a href="https://x.com/rsnous">Omar</a>! I recommend following him, he has consistently surprising and
    fascinating opinions and things to share about computers, for a very broad definition of "computer".)</p>

  <p>
    The replies also had some great examples (I recommend checking out the original tweet and reading the discussion
    though - it seems like tweeting about anything relating to "Systems" is still a reliable filter for good
    conversation on Twitter):

  <ul>
    <li>Automatic transactions, also to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) [<a
        href="https://x.com/funcOfJoe/status/1872824835535176031">tweet</a>]</li>
    <li>Unifying batch and real time,
      Locality sensitive hashing [<a href="https://x.com/bernhardsson/status/1872824334055817659">tweet</a>]</li>
    <li>Row-level security [<a href="https://x.com/jamesacowling/status/1872841383159185656">list</a>]</li>
    <li>WASM/WASI/Function-as-a-service (specifically in the context of systems programming?) as opposed to using POSIX
      features like cgroups, existing POSIX virtualisation technologies like firecracker [<a
        href="https://x.com/devgerred/status/1872827134689116258">tweet</a>]</li>
    <li>multi-cloud [<a href="https://x.com/pk_iv/status/1872823415780065496">tweet</a>]</li>
    <li>HATEOAS, especially resource discovery [<a href="https://x.com/devgerred/status/1872825214691885486">tweet</a>]
    </li>
  </ul>


  <p>The tweet and its responses got me thinking:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Most problems in computing have some "dumb" solutions that are simple, not optimally efficient (in space or time)
      but are applicable to a wide range of problems. Finding a specific, more efficient solution is satisfying as it
      justifies having learnt all the different solutions in college
    </li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
