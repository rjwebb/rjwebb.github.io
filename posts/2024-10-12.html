  <h1>12th October 2024</h1>

  <p>
    Today I'm at the library. It's a Saturday so I'm not working, but I am in the mood for some quiet focused activity.
  </p>


  <p>
    I watched Lu Wilson's talk "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o">What it means to be open</a>".
    They are SO RIGHT about the benefits of working in public and sharing <a
      href="https://www.todepond.com/sky/normalise-dont-share-lol/">scrappy fiddles</a>. I want to do this!

  </p>
  <p>
    There are so many things that I think about and create and never share because I do not consider those thoughts or
    creations to be ready for the outside world. I don't consider myself an artist but I do feel a deep need to connect
    to others and find common areas of interest. Sometimes I've found that I've shared something scrappy then someone I
    sort of vaguely know has stumbled across it, found that something in it resonates with them, then that forms the
    basis for a really satisfying conversation, or deeper friendship, or basically any good thing ever.

  <h2>long books</h2>

  <p>
    I'm currently reading Infinite Jest and I wondered, how long would it take for me to finish this book?
    I imagined an app that could track when I finish a page and then take the current timestamp, then calculate the
    average time it takes for me to read a page
    and extrapolate from that to see how long I would take. At that point I realised that it would be much simpler to
    just time myself reading a few pages and then calculate the answer by hand. So I read six pages and my girlfriend
    pressed the "lap" button on the timer on her phone to take some samples.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now I'm on page 420 and ignoring endnotes, the book is about 970 pages long. We calculated that it takes me
    one minute 10 seconds (or 70 seconds) on average to read a page (although I bet this varies hugely with energy
    level). Given that there are 550 pages left, that's 550 * 70 = 38500 seconds or 641 minutes or ~10 hours 41 minutes.
    I had been spending months reading this book in an extremely on-and-off way, a few minutes here and there with huge
    gaps. But calculating this made me realise that I could finish it, if I could just dedicate a few large blocks of
    time or one long-haul flight.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had a few ideas for the app:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A simple app that lets you enter in the current page and the total number of pages. It then gives you a huge
      button to press whenever you advance a page, which then logs the current time. It could then also display a
      prediction of when you would finish the book that it extrapolates from the timestamps. It could have another
      button to indicate when you "pause" reading the book.
    </li>
    <li>
      An app that functions as an ebook reader, so that reading and tracking time are integrated into the same
      application. Turning the page within the app would log a timestamp. Depending on the file format of the book,
      there could be different ways to implement this:
      <ul>
        <li>The app could take raw text files (e.g. from Gutenberg) as input and using the word position to measure how
          far along the book the reader is.</li>
        <li>Or the app could take pdf files and track the reader's progress by page.</li>
        <li>Or the app could take .epub files as input and choose between tracking by word or page, depending on what
          metadata is available (page markers?) in the epub file.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    .epub files
  </h3>

  <p>
    That got me thinking about .epub files. I knew that 1. most epub reader apps are terrible 2. epub files are
    basically zip files that contain websites but basically nothing else about them. I could look up information about
    them but I figured taking a look at them directly would be more fun.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started off with some ebooks I had lying around in my documents folder. For each one, I changed the file extension
    from ".epub" to ".zip", then unzipped them. I wrote a simple Python script to do this:
  </p>

  <pre>
    import os
    import shutil
    import zipfile

    for epub_filename in os.listdir("epubs"):
      # needed so that we can figure files like .DS_Store
      if not epub_filename.endswith(".epub"):
        continue

      book_name = epub_filename.split(".epub")[0]
      f_in_name= f"epubs/{epub_filename}"
      f_out_name = f"zips/{book_name}.zip"

      shutil.copyfile(f_in_name, f_out_name)

      with zipfile.ZipFile(f_out_name, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall(f"extracted/{book_name}")
  </pre>

  <p>
    Then I just looked through the unzipped folders by hand. Some observations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>there is always a file called "mimetype" with the contents "application/epub+zip".</li>
    <li>there is always a folder called "META_INF", which has a file called "container.xml".</li>
    <li>"container.xml" is an xml file which contains a "rootfile" tag with a reference to a file path which is usually
      "content.opf" or "OEBPS/content.opf" which has a mime type "application/oebps-package+xml".</li>
    <li> it seems like "content.opf" has the important ebook-specific metadata, like the title, authors names, chapter
      names, links to chapter files, etc. it also has a link to the table of contents, which is usually called
      "toc.ncx". "content.opf" is the "entry point" to all of the other parts of the file
    </li>
    <li>the META_INF folder may also container a "calibre_bookmarks.txt" file - i think this is actually created by the
      calibre ebook reader when you make a bookmark</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That's all I found out so far, next I want to look deeper into "content.opf" and the chapter files themselves.</p>
