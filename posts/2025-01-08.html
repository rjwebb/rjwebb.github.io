  <h1>Happy (belated) New Year!</h1>

  <em>8th January 2025</em>

  <p>In 2025, I want my (career? life?) focus to be to "<strong>learn whole systems programming</strong>". By this I
    mean
    making a conscious effort to understand what is happening at the layers in the stack that I do not usually pay
    attention to in my daily work as a web developer. I want this to include "systems programming" itself (e.g.
    operating systems, databases, compilers) as well as electronics, physical manufacturing (e.g. CAD/CAM, industrial
    processes) and "higher level" areas like finance, business, the mind (which necessarily also involves understanding
    the body and our beliefs around it).
  </p>

  <p>This is admittedly a broad and ambitious goal - but I think that even partial success will be worth it. Learning
    about one level of abstraction requires you to know at least something about its neighbouring layers - but then in
    order to understand those layers, you have to understand their neighbouring layers, and so on. <a

      an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe</a>.</p>

  <p>This goal also aligns with my other goal, which is to (re)build my social life. My girlfriend and I recently moved
    to Amsterdam. We know barely anyone here - in order to make friends it is necessary to have some idea where people
    one might get on with might be found. I've found some of my people at <a href="https://techinc.nl/">TechInc</a>, the
    local hackerspace. I feel like over the past few months I've become part of the community, just by turning up at the
    social nights every Wednesday and talking to people, mostly about technology. I want to learn all I can from them -
    at the very least I want to know how to 3D print things, engrave/cut material on our CNC router, improve my
    woodworking abilities, build electronic circuits, program microcontrollers, etc. It's also just a nice place to hang
    out, it feels a bit like being back in university.</p>


  <p>Other things I wish I had the time/energy to write about: Python 3.13 <a
      href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-free-threaded-cpython">free-threaded mode</a>,
    what I want to achieve with my Bluesky account, good food in Amsterdam, writing a <a
      href="https://github.com/rjwebb/noughts_and_crosses_nds/">tiny game</a> for the Nintendo DS, etc.
